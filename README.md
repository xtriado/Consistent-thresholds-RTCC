# Consistent-thresholds-RTCC
We developed a new methodological (trait-based) approach to identify distinct drivers of ecological community assembly. The method can first separate the combined effects of biotic and abiotic factors on changes of community composition along an environmental gradient, and, second, find consistent thresholds in the value of an environmental variable along the gradient indicating substantial structural changes in the leading drivers. Although we have developed this approach for microbial communities, it is completely general and can be applied to macro-organismal communities with the same easiness. Our method can help understand how the environment affects community assembly, which enables quantitative predictions for the ecological impact of environmental changes.
